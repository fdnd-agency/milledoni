### Added conventions
- The whole process will be documented in issues sorting on epic, feature and documentation etc.. We work with sub-issues for structure

- Comments will be added to the code to make everyone within and outside the team understand what you're working on

Guidelines branch
- Each branch should be created from the dev or another branch, but never the main
- Each branch should be connected to an issue (when having an issue open, you can click on 'create a branch' beneath 'development')
- When the branch is no longer in use, it should be deleted to avoid non-functioning branches
