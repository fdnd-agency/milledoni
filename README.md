# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.


## Introduction
We received the challenge to design and develop the Milledoni platform based on their new design. Our main focus was to renew and improve the website with better accessibility, responsiveness, and creative ideas to enhance the overall user experience.


## Homepage design
We redesigned the Milledoni homepage to give it a more creative look and to move away from the typical webshop appearance, which Milledoni specifically wanted to avoid. The design follows their brand identity, with the layout taking inspiration from the Pinterest platform. It was created for both mobile and desktop to ensure full responsiveness.

One of the main challenges was finding a good layout balance between the product section and the AI chat, especially on mobile devices.

Homepage Elements
- Header: Logo, account link, and a button to open the menu
- AI Chat: Allows users to filter products through an AI conversation
- Filter: Manual product filtering options
- Product Cards: Display the available products in a flex layout
- Footer: Contains additional navigation and contact information
